# Knowledge Skills

This directory contains the **Knowledge Skills** used by `knowledge-digest`.

Skills define *how raw content is transformed into structured knowledge*.
They are deterministic, reusable, and intentionally limited in scope.

## What are Knowledge Skills?

Knowledge Skills are **AI-assisted processing units** that perform
repeatable, mechanical tasks in the knowledge pipeline.

They do **not** decide what is valuable.
They do **not** replace human judgment.

> Skills transform content.  
> Humans decide whether it matters.

## Responsibilities of Skills

Each Knowledge Skill is responsible for:

- Fetching or processing source content
- Extracting key ideas from the source
- Structuring output using `NOTE_TEMPLATE.md`
- Normalizing metadata (author, dates, topics, tags)
- Explicitly stating uncertainty or missing information
- Assigning a confidence level to the output

The output of a skill is always a **draft**, never a final truth.

## What Skills deliberately do NOT do

To avoid overreach and hallucination, skills must NOT:

- Decide whether a piece of content is worth keeping
- Filter content based on “importance”
- Invent facts or fill gaps silently
- Optimize for style over accuracy
- Replace the human review step

If a skill cannot confidently infer something from the source,
it must say so explicitly.
