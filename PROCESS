# PROCESS

This document describes the end-to-end workflow of **knowledge-digest**.

The goal is simple:

> Turn scattered reading into **reviewed, structured, reusable knowledge**  
> with **minimal human effort**.

---

## Overview

The system is designed as an **automated pipeline with a human review gate**.

- AI handles repetitive, mechanical work
- Humans only make value judgments

The human answers one question:

> **Is this worth keeping?**

---

## High-level flow

Link → Fetch → Digest → Review → Commit → Reuse


---

## Step-by-step process

### 1. Input: discover content

**Trigger**
- A good article found via WeChat, web, or any other source

**Human responsibility**
- Decide that the content is *potentially* worth processing
- Send the link to OpenClaw

No summarization, no categorization at this stage.

---

### 2. Fetch: retrieve original content

**Handled by**
- OpenClaw

**What happens**
- Download or extract the original content
- Store the raw source locally for traceability

**Why this matters**
- Keeps a stable reference to the original material
- Avoids relying solely on AI-generated summaries

---

### 3. Digest: structure the knowledge

**Handled by**
- Custom Knowledge Skills

**Responsibilities**
- Extract key ideas
- Generate a structured knowledge digest
- Normalize metadata (author, date, topics, tags)
- Populate a note using `NOTE_TEMPLATE.md`

**Important rule**
- If information is missing or uncertain, the skill must:
  - state it explicitly
  - lower the confidence level

At this stage, the output is a **draft knowledge digest**.

---

### 4. Review: human-in-the-loop

**Handled by**
- Human reviewer

**Review focus**
- Is the content worth keeping?
- Are the key ideas accurate?
- Is the “Why this matters” section meaningful?
- Are the takeaways actually reusable?

Humans do **not** rewrite everything.
They only correct, refine, or reject.

If rejected, the pipeline stops here.

---

### 5. Commit: store as long-term memory

**Handled by**
- OpenClaw + GitHub

**What happens**
- Approved digest is committed to the repository
- Commit message follows a consistent format
- Git history becomes the audit trail

GitHub acts as:
- the storage layer
- the review boundary
- the long-term memory

---

### 6. Reuse: knowledge as an asset

Once committed, knowledge digests can be:
- searched
- compared across topics
- grouped by author
- reused in future decisions, designs, or explanations

At this point, knowledge is no longer “saved” —  
it becomes **available for use**.

---

## Roles and responsibilities

### Human
- Decide keep / discard
- Refine meaning, not format
- Own value judgment

### AI (OpenClaw + Skills)
- Fetch content
- Extract structure
- Normalize format
- Handle repetition consistently

---

## Design constraints

- No heavy taxonomy
- No mandatory manual categorization
- No AI-based value judgment
- Low friction at every step

If a step adds cognitive load without reducing human effort,
it does not belong in this pipeline.

---

## Guiding principle

> Knowledge is not a collection problem.  
> It is a **processing problem**.

This workflow treats personal knowledge
as an **engineering system**, not a personal habit.
